## Assignment 1

You can find the video [here](https://youtu.be/MR4XaC_MEC8). The code is located in [here](https://github.com/StinkyMilo/IMGD4099/blob/main/Assignment1/wgslcode.txt), and the intent paragraphs and feedback are [here](https://github.com/StinkyMilo/IMGD4099/blob/main/Assignment1/aesthetic-intent-and-feedback.md).

### Functions used

To make it a bit easier, I figured I'd list the 12 functions I used: cos, sin, floor, max, min, distance, sqrt, step, smoothstep, tanh, clamp, abs

### Feedback:
I've posted to the discord, and I've provided some feedback, but I have yet to receive any! (but my girlfriend said it was cool if that counts for anything!) I'll update this with a summary of feedback as soon as I get any.
